09/11/2009 The variable "dpi_day" was not being initialized in cNoradSDP4.
           Thanks to H. Krispin et al.

01/25/2009 Repaired a debug assert call in cJulian.cpp that was incorrectly
           triggering when calculating dates on December 31 during leap
           years. Thanks to R. Kummerer for uncovering this problem.

01/02/2009 The orbit axis recovered from orbital elements is now correctly
           associated with the semimajor axis (and not the semiminor axis).
           This change does not effect SGP4/SDP4 output calculations, but
           does correct class cOrbit's convenience methods SemiMajor, SemiMinor,
           Major, Minor, etc. Thanks to C. Wee for discovering this issue.

           The cOrbit class method "mnMotionRec" was renamed to "MeanMotion".

06/21/2006 Since the cNoradBase class has a virtual function, good design
           practice dictates it also have a virtual destructor. A Gnu
           compiler warning sent by R. Graham.

10/16/2005 Do not use time_t type when calculating the epoch for ECI 
           coordinates. Thanks to the U.K's M. Trethewey for locating yet 
           another time_t problem.
           
           Updated class cJulian with a new constructor and "span" functions.
   
07/19/2005 Fixed error in calculating m_kmPerigeeRec, which is not used by 
           SGP4 or SDP4 calculations. Added m_kmApogeeRec and corresponding
           accessor function cOrbit.Apogee().
           
06/22/2005 MSVC++ 7.0 compiler/library change: pow(int, int) now returns 0 if
           the exponent is less than 0. Updated ExpToDecimal() to use 
           pow(double, double) instead. This was not pow() behavior in 
           MSVC++ 6.0. Thanks to Dr. Andy Register for first reporting this 
           issue.

08/29/2004 More time_t problems: A truncation error in CJulian::toTime() was
           causing time_t values to have an average error of 0.5 seconds from
           their Julian counterpart.
           
05/23/2004 Julian date class now calculates year, month, day, without using
           time_t type, which only has a resolution of 1 second. This was 
           causing errors when calculating azimuth and elevation for 
           satellites which pass near the zenith. Thanks to Markus Knapek 
           in Germany for first reporting this issue.
